# Virtual-Pet

by Greg Cain

## Description

I'm creating this project as part of my studies with [Manchester Codes](https://www.manchestercodes.com/).

## Roadmap

~~I should hopefully have this all finished by the end of week 4 of this module, which I think is Christmas Day ðŸ™ƒ~~

I have actually finished following the track for this project, but I still have some plans for this project!

- update to object class
- add more properties (with aim to making pets more pokemon-like and able to fight)
- add gui

## Support

Thank you to all the support from tutors and fellow coursemates at Manchester Codes ðŸ™Œ
